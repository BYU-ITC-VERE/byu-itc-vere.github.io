## Welcome Everyone!

* The lab door should unlock before class. During other times, your ID card should open the door. They wait until after the add/drop period before setting it up so it may be Wednesday or Thursday before that works. The door should remain closed and locked most of the time because we have valuable equipment here.
* Review everything on LearningSuite - get familiar with the schedule!
* Your first CTF is due Saturday. Are you working on it?
