* Peer Review of Writeups
    * Today I emailed each of you the peer review of your Web-4 writeup.
    * You have until next **Wednesday, Feb 26** to revise your Web-4 writeup based on peer feedback. Please resubmit your revision to the Web-4 CTF Writeup assignment. If you are content with your original submission you can leave it alone and we will grade that version.
    * Thank you for your patience as I (Prof. Redd) figured out this process. It will go more smoothly next time.
