## Welcome Everyone!

* The lab door should unlock before class. During other times, your ID card should open the door. Please check, they may not all be loaded yet.
* Review everything on LearningSuite - get familiar with the layout!
* Install OpenVPN and the CTFd Profile
    * The link to the VERE CTFd will only work while your VPN is connected.
* Your first CTF is due a week from Saturday. You have a little time to ramp up but after that they will come fast and furious. (Actually, just weekly.)
