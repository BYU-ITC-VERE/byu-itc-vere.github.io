* Like Web-4, your Rev-4 writeup will be peer-reviewed
    * This afternoon I will distribute Rev-4 writeups to peers for review.
    * Your peer review is due on **Saturday.**
    * Following that, I will forward reviews back to you and you will be able to update your Rev-4 writeup according to the feedback.
    * You will receive grades for both your peer review and for your Rev-4 writeup.
