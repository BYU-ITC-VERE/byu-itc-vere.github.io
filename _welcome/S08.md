* Gradebook Updates
    * For ease in recording scores, your weekly writeup scores are now separate from the challenges (flags) in the gradebook. The impact of each assignment on your final grade is **unchanged**.
    * Even though they are on different point scales, each writeup counts equally with the corresponding challenge flags.
* Peer Review of Writeups
    * Peer review is set up in the LearningSuite gradebook.
    * Be sure to submit your CTF-4 writeup **in MarkDown** by this Saturday, February 8.
    * You will receive the writeup from one of your peers by email early next week.
    * Add your review **in MarkDown** to the writeup and submit it by Saturday, February 15.
    * Details are in the announcements in LearningSuite.
* CSRF-CORS walkthrough is available at [https://byu-itc-210.github.io/walkthrough/CSRF-CORS](https://byu-itc-210.github.io/walkthrough/CSRF-CORS). This is a beta test before the 210 students get it in a few weeks. I'm interested in feedback.
