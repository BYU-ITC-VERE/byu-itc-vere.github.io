* My RestSpace walkthrough of CSRF vulnerabilities and protections will be back in order this afternoon.
    * When I reviewed it, I found vulnerabilities that weren't supposed to be there.ðŸ˜¬
* The new Peer Review assignments will be in LearningSuite this afternoon.
* **Repeat** Oral presentations are being replaced by peer review of writeups.
    * Your writeup for Web-4 should be written in **MarkDown**.
    * You will submit your writeup for Web-4 CTF.
    * Your writeup will be sent to a classmate who wrote up the same CTF and you will receive a writeup from a classmate who wrote up the same CTF.
    * You will write and submit peer review of your classmate's writeup.
    * You will update and re-submit your own writeup based on peer feedback.
    * You will be graded on your peer review and on your final writeup.
    * Details on how to submit everything will appear in LearningSuite by end-of-day on Monday.

* Web-3 CTF due on Saturday.
* Writeups are worth a lot! Take notes and write them well.
