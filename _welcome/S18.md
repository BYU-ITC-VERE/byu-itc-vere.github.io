* Like Web-4, your Rev-4 writeup will be peer-reviewed
    * Your writeup for Rev-4 should be written in **MakDown**.
    * You will submit your writeup for Rev-4 CTF.
    * Your writeup will be sent to a classmate who wrote up the same CTF and you will receive a writeup from a classmate who wrote up the same CTF.
    * You will write and submit peer review of your classmate's writeup.
    * You will update and re-submit your own writeup based on peer feedback.
    * You will be graded on your peer review AND on your final writeup.
    * Details will be on LearningSuite - just like Web-4
    * If you don't submit a Rev-4 writeup you will miss two grades - one for Rev-4 writeup and one for the peer review. So, don't miss it!
